# ORIGIN #
This project is an exercise done as part of an OpenClassrooms training course for developers in the Python language.
It corresponds to project 7 of the training.


# GOAL OF THE APPLICATION #
This application xxx


# FEATURES #
* AJAX interactions: the user sends his question by pressing enter and the answer is displayed directly on the screen, without reloading the page.
* We use the Google Maps API and the Media Wiki API.
* Nothing is saved. If the user reloads the page, all history is lost.
* Option: invent several different responses from GrandPy.


# USER PATH #
The user opens their browser and enters the URL you have provided. They are presented with a page containing the following elements

    * header: logo and catchphrase
    * central zone: empty zone (which will be used to display the dialogue) and form field for sending a question.
    * footer: your first & last name, link to your Github repository and other social networks if you have them

The user types "Hi GrandPy! Do you know the address of OpenClassrooms?" in the form field and then press the Enter key. The message is displayed in the area above, which shows all messages exchanged. An icon rotates to indicate that GrandPy is thinking.

Then a new message appears: "Of course my chick! Here it is: 7 cité Paradis, 75010 Paris." Underneath, a Google Maps map also appears with a marker indicating the requested address.

GrandPy sends a new message: "But did I ever tell you the story of this neighbourhood that saw me in short pants? The Cité Paradis is a public road in the 10th arrondissement of Paris. It is tee-shaped, with one branch leading to 43 rue de Paradis, the second to 57 rue d'Hauteville and the third to a dead end."


# CONSTRAINTS #
* Responsive interface
* Test Driven Development
* Code written entirely in English: functions, variables, comments, etc.
* Use of AJAX to send questions and display answers (questions and answers are in one language only, English or French)
* Tests using mocks for APIs
